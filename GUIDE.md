# How to write a post

### The title

*[Style: Heading 2, Bold, Color: Black]*

The title in a post is very important. Generally, it is what catches the reader's attention, particularly for those who are searching for a solution among many posts. It should be clear, straightforward, and avoid any confusing terminology.

### The cover image

Always try to include a cover image at the beginning of the post, as it helps catching the attention of the reader.
Here are some links to find images: https://unsplash.com, https://www.pexels.com. Remember that they should be public.

### The introduction

The first paragraph or two, after the cover image, will either convince the reader to stay on or lose their attention. Start off with a little bit of context to help people understand where your post fits into the big picture.

Try not to include technical details. You can talk about your background, why you are writing and which is the target audience of the post.

### Writing the details

Now that you’ve told your readers what to expect, give it to them! Feel free to go into as much detail as you need.

Use sections to help people understand where they are, and enable them to skip around to the content they are most interested in. Breaking sections down into subsections makes things easier to manage for you as a writer and allows readers to quickly pick up where they stop.

Use [Github Gists](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-gists) for displaying code if necessary. Don’t be lazy and use the native code block. Code presentation matters for your readers to read properly.

Avoid talking about things which the reader may already know. Basically, take into account who is supposed to read the post when explaining your ideas. Also, when using images always ask yourself: does this image add any value? If the answer is no, then you should omit it.

Keep the length of the post between 1200 and 1500 words. If it takes more than that, consider separating it into parts and have links to each of them.

### Summary

After explaining everything, don't just end the post there. If your reader has made it all the way there, they really care. Give them a quick summary of what they learned, a pat on the back for reading, and maybe even some possible applications. Also, if it's a series of posts, give a general overview of the next part and make clear if it is ready by adding the link.

### Guidelines

- Define a good title.
- Use sections and subsections.
- Images:
    - Should act as a further explainer of your main point.
    - Omit them if they don't add any value.
    - Utilize diagrams to get your points across for complex ideas.
    - Include references if they are from another post or article.
    - Center them if they are not wide enough.
- Enumerate figures and tables so that they can be easily identified when making reference to them in the text.
- 1200 - 1500 words. Separate in parts if necessary and link each part. [Here](https://www.rootstrap.com/tech-blog/2018/12/05/moving-from-java-spring-framework-to-a-reactjsapis-architecture) is an example of 1500.
- Mark tech keywords.
- Keep consistency along the post with the personal pronoun you are using (1st, 2nd or 3rd person).
- Use Github Gists code blocks.
- Include links to more information.
- Take into account who should read the post when using the terminology. If you’re writing a ruby post, is it for advanced or beginner developers?
