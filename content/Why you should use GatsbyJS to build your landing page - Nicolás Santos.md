### SEO (Search engine optimization)
SEO is vital for your landing page, allows to your website shows on the search engine what is translated in more views. With Gatsby, much of this problem is resolved as long as Gatsby generates static pages, which means the crawler of the search engine will take all the information of your page without loading the Javascript of your site, but there are other things we can do for improve this. We can add the plugin `react-helmet` for Gatsby because this is important not just for site viewers, but also for SEO â€” title and description metadata stored in the document head is a key component used by Google in determining placement in search results.
