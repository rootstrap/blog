# Choosing a text editor

It may be a tough decision, as a programmer, the text editor that you choose will be your main tool to do your work, and you will use it every day in your work-life.

Everybody has their favorite text editor, in my life I have known people who use **Vim, Notepad++, Sublime Text, Atom**, and many others.

I tried different text editors in my career, always looking for a perfect one -- at first I started with SublimeText, later the pretty UI of Atom hook me, and for the last year I have been coding with **Visual Studio Code**.

I was enjoying Atom, but in some cases, my computer at the time couldn't handle it very well and it was getting a bit laggy to open the text editor or work with it. So a friend of mine told me that maybe Visual Studio Code could fit my needs, and he was right.

# I use Visual Studio Code too! Tell me about the extensions

## [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens)

This extension includes a lot of cool functionalities of Git in Visual Studio Code "GitLens simply helps you **better understand code**" says Eric Amodio, the creator of the extension.

I love Gitlens because it permits me to detect who wrote the code that I am reading, this is really useful because when I have doubts about the code, I know who to talk to.
