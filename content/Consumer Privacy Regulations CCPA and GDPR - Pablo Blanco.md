California is considered the world’s 5th biggest economy, ranking higher than
some European countries. This is not a surprise as it's home to
Silicon Valley, the world’s premier innovation hub and headquarters of several multiple tech giants.

Given the numerous data breaches and inappropriate use of customer’s information for
targeted advertising,
there is growing public concern regardung the misuse of
personal information, security, and privacy. Data privacy regulations are
becoming a primary element in any data security conversation. In the case of
the Union GDPR (2018),  Brazilian LGPD (2020), and the California Consumer
Privacy Act (2020), the ability to protect personal information is a top priority. 
For companies that base their operations around customer data, trust becomes an
essential part of their business model.

In this article, we will explore some concepts of California's
Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), similarities and differences between CCPA and GDPR
regulations, and the impacts generated by these regulations.

## CCPA Overview

While the GDPR was created to protect citizens of the EU,
CCPA is an outcome of the GDPR, changing government priorities, and making them
more willing to protect individual privacy. Although the CCPA is relatively new,
it’s important to be aware of the
policies and processes necessary for compliance, and
the future impact it will have in comparison to GDPR.

This California state law establishes new consumer rights relating to the access
of personal information that is held by businesses. The meaning of Personal
information is quite broad, the definition given in
[CCPA](https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/) says:

_Personal information is information that identifies, relates to, or could
reasonably be linked with an individual or household._

Some examples of that are customer personal and private information,
internet browsing history,
 geolocation data, fingerprints, IP addresses, etc.
Personal information does not include 
available information from federal, state, or local government records.

Businesses have a track record of using personal information to benefit their
agenda and the CCPA  serves to protect California consumer rights and encourage
stronger privacy, traceability, and transparency. The CCPA allows
consumers to have control, ownership, and gain security over their personal
information.  They also allow for the request that any business disclose
, and if necessary, delete any personal information collected.

This data protection gives consumers the right to:

- Know what personal information is collected.
- Access to and the option to delete any necessary personal information.
- Knowledge of who their personal information is being shared with
  and the option to deny such access.
- Have equal service, price,
and privacy rights (right to non-discrimination).

It’s should also be noted that it is illegal to sell personal information of any consumers aged 13–16.
without the consent of a parent or guardian.

## Who does the CCPA apply to?

CCPA defines a business as a for-profit entity, that collects consumer personal
data, and applies to all companies that serve California residents.
Companies may be subject to
compliance if it meets at least one of the following thresholds:

- A minimum of $25 million in annual revenue 
Annually buy, sell, receive, or share personal information of
  at least 50,000 consumers, homes, or devices for commercial purposes.
- Companies that derive 50% or more of their annual revenue from the sale of
  personal information.

## CCPA vs GDPR: What are the differences?

The European General Data Protection Regulation is an evolution of the EU’s
existing data rules and replaced the Data Protection Directive (DPD). It
addresses many of the weaknesses in the DPD, including adding requirements for
documenting IT procedures, performing risk assessments under certain conditions,
notifying the consumer and authorities when there is a breach, and strengthening
rules for data minimization.

The GDPR protects similar private data as the CCPA recommends that companies
provide a “reasonable” level of protection for personal information. It also
mandates that the business explains to the customer how their information will
be used and to explicitly ask for their permission to collect and process it.

No matter how influenced the CCPA may have been by the GDPR, there are some
clear differences we should notice in each legislation. Although the two laws
are quite similar, the CCPA differs from the GDPR in a few important ways:

- **Impacted businesses**: where businesses of any size must comply with the
  GDPR, the CCPA only impacts businesses that reach a certain size and
  process a certain amount of data from consumers.
- **Penalties**: GDPR penalties are capped based on a company’s annual revenue,
  on the other hand, CCPA penalties have no limit and are assessed per violation
  and number of affected consumers.
- **Opt-in/Opt-out**: Under GDPR, businesses must have opt-in from consumers
  before collecting data. In the case of CCPA, consumers must opt-out of data
  collection.
- **Third-party data sales**:  GDPR businesses must have consent from
  customers before any third-party processing or sales its data, while the CCPA
  requires businesses to simply notify the customer of a data sale or transfer,
  with the option to refuse.

In short, both regulations give more power to consumers and enable them to take
action if they want their data to remain private. Besides that, businesses are
required to adhere to their requests.

## Does CCPA apply to my business?

Unbeknownst to some, CCPA doesn’t just apply to businesses based
physically in California, but any business with customers who reside in the state

Under the CCPA, businesses must be aware of what is considered private data,
locate and treat customers information in a secure way, even addressing their
vendors to ensure that they are compliant too.

To protect customer’s personal information, businesses need to know what data
they have, where it resides, and how it is processed. In this way, they can set
up the appropriate security measures to be compliant with this regulation.

Companies must realize that the impact of the CCPA is no trivial matter. They
have to begin preparing now to become compliant, if they don’t, they will face
reputation damage, fines, and loss of customer’s trust. Being prepared for this
kind of regulation will bring a smooth path for the future ones that will come and
In other words, it will pay to be compliant, and consumers will value you for it.

## How to be prepared for CCPA

As soon as you know that your business is subject to CCPA, you can start working
to be compliant. The following steps can be useful to help get ready:

- **Roadmap**: Create a plan to help achieve compliance with CCPA.
- **Learn**: Know your obligations and be aware of any changing requirements.
- **Data Map**: Identity what personal information you collect from customers,
  why it is being collected, where it is stored, how secure it is, and who it is being shared with. 
- **Privacy policy**: Update your privacy notices to comply with
  CCPA’s requirements. You can also provide your customers with a **“Do Not Sell My Information** option.
- **Consumer requests**: Establish a system for processing consumer rights requests.
-
- **Train**: Educate your team on how to handle personal information and consumer requests.
- **Security**: Enforce the security of personal information
with risk assessment, and
 an incident response plan.
- **Check Providers**: Evaluate your upstream and downstream contracts with
  third-party service providers and modify the underlying agreements for CCPA
  compliance. Think about your standard data-sharing practices, including
  relationships with data aggregators, data brokers, etc.

## What about CCPA and HIPAA? (case scenario)

Despite its broad scope, CCPA creates certain exemptions designed around HIPAA
and other laws. For example, CCPA does not apply to “Protected Health
Information” (PHI) as defined in HIPAA. This is collected by a covered entity
or business associate.

CCPA’s HIPAA exemption is meant to allow covered entities and business
associates to continue following the privacy regulations laid out in HIPAA
without interference from an additional law. CCPA exempts an organization that
“maintains patient information in the same manner” as PHI under HIPAA.

Healthcare providers and insurance agents may assume that the law’s HIPAA
exemption will cover PHI and other customer information. So we have good news,
if your business is HIPAA compliant, you are not required to apply extra
measures to protect your patients' and customers’ information. Now let’s take a
look at some examples where the exemption applies and not.

**Case 1**: Assume that you own a sportswear company that sells products in
California and you have developed a step-counter app that users can download to
their phones through Google Play and App Store. The app tracks the number of
steps a user takes each day and captures additional information, including the
user's name, birthday, weight, calories burned, geolocation, and walking
average. That company is probably not a covered entity or business associate
under HIPAA and would not be able to apply to the CCPA's HIPAA exemption.

**Case 2**: Now consider a health care system "operating" in California that
created an app with the same features as the previous case, yet made the app
available only to its patients to monitor their health and treat medical
conditions. That organization is a covered entity under HIPAA, the data is
probably PHI, and the HIPAA exemption probably applies.

## Final thoughts

Data privacy regulations will demand a lot of work in the preparedness to be
compliance, but being forced to optimizing the data that a company collects,
processes and stores could create efficiency. Companies need only store the
necessary pieces of personal information to perform their services and reduce
the time and resources (they have spent in the past) to store all of it.
Compliance can be viewed as a company’s competitive advantage by offering
consumers peace of mind that their data is protected and secure.

I believe that CCPA is a powerful law that will be a big win for both consumers
and businesses, and will help to put the United States at the same level as
Europe with GDPR in the global privacy discussion. This law came to stay and
leverage the rights between consumers and business, giving the former the chance
to know what a company knows about them, decide whether or not they can keep
that information, and prevent them from selling it.

Governments are beginning to take data privacy very seriously. Like in the
European Union, Brazil, India, Japan, and other countries, the CCPA will have
far more impacts across state jurisdictions, reaching companies around the
world. Getting prepared to be compliant is important and will save your company
a lot of money, time, and reputation. To be compliant with these regulations can
be a hard work to achieve, you need to be able to identify content related to a
data subject, classify and protect consumer data, and sometimes even delete upon
request. But there is some light at the end of the tunnel, if you get your
business prepared for this kind of regulation, you will get a competitive
advantage and it will be easy to get ready for new regulations as there are many
more on the horizon.
