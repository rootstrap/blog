# Warm Data — 5 Things You Have to Know
We are living in a world where ‘data is the new oil’ has become a common phrase. However, we usually see one dimension of data, categorizing its types, and creating basic hypotheses about supposed correlations. Understanding its implications and providing data-backed decisions is not an easy matter. Big Data usually derives [information and knowledge](https://towardsdatascience.com/rootstrap-dikw-model-32cef9ae6dfb) by pulling things out of context. 
We can go one level deeper, though. We can choose to do it because it’s hard and insightful. 

**To understand living and complex systems, there’s a need for a kind of information that holds the interrelationships and interdependencies of all the different aspects of the process.**

We don’t have a way to derive knowledge from that very important interrelational reality. We can have decontextualized specific detailed data, and have another thing, warm data, that will give us the information about how the system was working. These two kinds of information can coexist and work in conjunction with each other. We can answer different types of questions with different types of data.

## What is Warm Data?
It is information about the interrelationships that integrate elements of a complex system. It has found the qualitative dynamics and offers another dimension of understanding of what is learned through quantitative data (cold data).

A good way to understand it is through an example. Let’s think for a minute about our diet and nutritional data about our food. 

We can ask ourselves what are the relationships in which this food came to be? 

Is it economic, cultural, political, family habits? 

How is it in relation to your health? And with your microbiome? 

How does it affect your community’s economy? And your own economy?

A lot of information about your food actually matters. This information doesn’t give you the same cold facts. It gives you context. 

## Why is Warm Data important?
Our way to study the world has largely been to study things out of context. Research has developed a lot since the 1600s, researchers now pull things out of context and study them in great detail, generating a lot of new knowledge out of them but it’s simply not enough.

In order to interfere with any complex system without disrupting the circuitry of the interdependencies that give it its integrity, we must look at the spread of relationships that make the system robust. Using only analysis of statistical data will offer conclusions that can point to actions that are out of sync with the complexity of the situation. Information that doesn’t interrelate is likely to lead us toward misinformed actions, thereby creating further destructive patterns.

## In which fields might Warm Data be important?
It can be applied to virtually everything, such as economics, sociology, ecology, business, healthcare, etc. 

Warm Data is a specific kind of information about the way parts of a complex system, such as members of a family, organisms in the oceans, institutions in society, or departments of an organization, come together to give vitality to that system. By contrast, other data will describe only the parts, while Warm Data describes their interplay in context.

## What are we trying to achieve?
Our purpose is to look in other ways so that we potentially find other species of information and new patterns of connection not visible though current methodologies.

It allows people to see new patterns, new causations, and to respond to them with a much broader comprehension. In this way, it enables new societal responses to complex challenges.

As a methodology, gathering warm data is useful for those interested in strengthening and further practicing their collective ability to perceive, discuss, and research complex issues. By shifting perspectives through a trans-contextual conversational structure, it increases people’s abilities to respond to difficult or “wicked” issues. Because so many of the challenges that we face now are complex, we need approaches to meet that complexity that reaches beyond static analysis. Although there is a desire to reframe these complex issues in simple terms that might lend themselves to easy solutions, such simplistic reframing usually leads to the dangers of unintended consequences of reductionism…and further problems.

## What’s next?
The definition and scope of Warm Data is not even close to being fully defined. The realization that this kind of problem requires a different approach, and it’s actually a different kind of data, it’s the foundation to embrace the research. 
As data scientists, engineers, researchers, we have to try to understand the relationships in their context, instead of taking shortcuts to analyze data by pulling them out from where they originally live.
