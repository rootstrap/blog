## Heuristics Decision Making Process
How do Heuristics affect decision making? Unconsciously we use mental shortcuts for decision making. These biased shortcuts are called rules of thumb. We cannot remove the bais, because it is how our brain works, but we can be aware of it and avoid common errors. Being unaware of this human condition can generate biases that lead to erroneous judgments. This fact is very important at the time of collecting data as well as evaluating the results from the algorithms. 
These mental shortcuts are applied when there is uncertainty during the decision-making process which we all can agree happens more often than not. The most common bias are best divided into three categories:

**Representativeness:** representations that people might already have formed in their heads to later make assumptions based on those stereotypes.     

1. **Insensitivity to base rates:** people ignore the prior probability in the estimation of an outcome, giving more relevance to the stereotype that they have formed rather than the given base rates.
2. **Insensitivity to sample size:** people do not consider the sample size when estimating a probability.
3. **Misconceptions of chance:** people expect that random and non-random events will balance out.   
4. **Regression toward the mean:** individuals ignore that extreme events tend to regress to the mean on subsequent trials. 
5. **The conjunction fallacy:** individuals tend to think that the co-occurrence of two events is more probable than a more global set of occurrences of which the conjunction is a subset. 

**Availability:** when evaluating the frequency or probability of an event, decisions are probably influenced by the availability of thoughts that immediately come to mind. As a consequence, people tend to overestimate/under-estimate.    

1. **Easy of recall:** people judge events that are more easily recalled from memory, events that recently occur as more frequent than other events with the same frequency that are not as instantly recalled. 
2. **Retrievability:** individuals are biased in assessments of frequency because of how memory is structured and the search mechanisms that they use. 
3. **Presumed associations:** overestimate the probability of 2 events co-occurring based on the number of similar associations they can easily recall. 

**Anchoring and Adjustment:** when an initial piece of information is used as an anchor or reference point then adjustments are made to post judgments around that anchor. Thus, there is a tendency to rely too heavily on the reference point and this can lead people to make wrong estimations.      

1. **Insufficient anchor adjustment:** making estimates for values basing on an initial value derived from past data, and make insufficient adjustment form that anchor when establishing the final value.      
2. **Conjunctive and disjunctive events:** overestimating the probability of conjunctive events and underestimating the probability of disjunctive events.     
3. **Overconfidence:** people usually are overconfident about the infallibility of their judgments. 

# Conclusion
We cannot get rid of judgment and bias. But we should be aware that our brain makes some misconceptions and might convince us about something that is not true. Thus, always try to find the proof of your assumptions, try to validate with the data what it seems obvious to you. Do not let your brain persuade you to erroneous results! You have the data, so use it!
