# Pushing your article for review

Once you decided to write an article, you can start working directly into the repository by creating a markdown formatted file in `content/<article-title> - <author-name>.md` and start writing!

When you think your article is ready to be reviewed, you can open up a Pull Request on the repo. The same as when creating an issue, you will have a basic template to follow and include some extra information about your article. It’s very important to include a reference to the originating issue to be able to keep a trace of the work being done on the blog.

At that point, one or more content reviewers will be assigned by the blog maintainers to the article. They will take care of reviewing the technical content of the article, making sure everything makes sense and nothing important is missing.
Once the content is reviewed and considerd ready for publishing, one last review will be done by Austin, who will make sure the grammar, structure and story telling of the article is top notch, taking care of enhancing it's readadbility and appeal.

Other than that, all the same practices we’re already following for [code reviews](https://github.com/rootstrap/tech-guides/tree/master/code-review) should be taken into account on this process.

Lastly, when the review process has been completed, your article will be merged into the repo, the originating issue will be closed, and your article will be scheduled to be released. To finish the process, you should work with the person in charge of the blog styling to work on your content and get it ready to be presented to the world!
