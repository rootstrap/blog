# Submit an idea

For the management of proposals and new ideas for blog posts, we use this repo's [issues](https://github.com/rootstrap/blog/issues). If you have an idea for an article, either you want to write it yourself or not, you can create a new issue describing it and tagging it accordingly depending on which category the article would fit in.

To make this process easier, we provide an issue template where we ask you for some basic information on your proposal: what’s the motivation for writing about the topic, some notes on the idea itself and possible keywords to identify the article with.

Once you create the issue, you can either assign it to yourself if you’re planning on writing the article, or you can leave it unassigned for anyone interested to pick it up. The blog maintainers will reach out to the reporter and assignee to further refine the idea and eventually decide to include it on a blog release.

**IMPORTANT:** We highly recommend you create an issue before starting to write an article. During the submitting process the idea may change a bit and new ideas may come up, causing the scope of the article to change. This is not to discourage you to start writing articles, but to be aware that changes may happen when going through the pipeline.
